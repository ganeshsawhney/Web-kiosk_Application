•	The header files used are:
1.	String.h
2.	Stdlib.h
3.	Stdio.h

•	Every data has been stored and read in link list.
•	We have used different structures for storing:-
1.	Enrollment No. & Name & Batch.
2.	Date/Attendance.
•	Both the structures have been joined using pointers and other concepts of multilinked list.
•	Every data has been stored in a file and in the beginning of the program the data has been read again and stored for a better compatibility and for ease.
•	Major File Handling Concepts have been used for the above mentioned point.
